            <h3>History of Traffic Control</h3>
      </div>
	  <!-- This is one of the main text fields -->
      <div class= "mainText">
          <p>The first unmanned traffic control system was unveiled in the 1920, created by William Potts. It was created for 4-way junctions and would cycle through the lights according to a set timing system. The next development was created several years later, as was to incorporate microphones into the system, using car horns to change the lights. After the lights changed, they would remain the same way for 10 seconds before they could be interacted with again. The former system saw a much wider audience, as it was much more affordable to implement and maintain, it was also preferred much more by those living near the lights, as they were much less disruptive to them. This system remained until the 1960s, where computers were powerful enough to start using more advanced means of detecting vehicles, using sensors to detect traffic, and adjust signal timings accordingly.

          <h3>Alternatives to Current Methods</h3>
      </div>
	  <!-- This is one of the main text fields -->
      <div class= "mainText">
          <p>The theory of using automated vehicles, connected to a central computer that controls the entire flow of traffic has been offered before, but has not been able to gain traction as the many requirements for that have not yet been met, such as the requirement for all vehicles on the road to have the appropriate hardware to be able to communicate with a central computer at a fast enough speed. However other ideas have been given, tested, and implemented in various locations around the world.</p>

          <p>Another method of reducing the environmental impact of cars would be to reduce their usage via linking multiple methods of public transport together, and having them operate from the same system, allowing users to better navigate them, and reducing the usage of private vehicles in urban areas. A system like this has been adopted by Amsterdam, The Netherlands, with trains, buses, trams, metros, and ferries being controlled by GVB, allowing them to all work together and allow users to travel around the city using only public transport. (I amsterdam, 2022) </p>

          <p>Car parks can also help reduce emissions by adopting smarter systems. They could do this by using sensors to measure how many parking spaces are available, they could then transmit this data to a widely used traffic management network, such as Google Maps. Google could then inform users looking to park which car parks have available spaces, how many, and where they are. This would reduce emissions as cars would spend less time driving around looking for spaces to park, as they are directed towards places where they are confirmed to be able to stop.</p>

          <p>In 2015 Ford publicised and tested a feature called “Traffic Jam Assist”, which would control the car’s speed, making it travel at the same speed as the vehicle in front of it, easing drivers stuck in traffic, and reducing emissions as the system doesn’t waste fuel where a person driving might. The system could potentially help keep drivers calm, helping reduce their emissions, as they would not getting as frustrated as they might do otherwise. (Ford, 2015) </p>
