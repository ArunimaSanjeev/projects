			<h3>Automated Heating Systems</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="mainText">
			<p>One example of a home automation system that has been developed to replace its traditional counterpart to benefit the environment is the introduction of intelligent heating systems. This is a major step in reducing energy consumption since heating the home represents a large segment of the overall energy consumed in the UK, with home heating systems making up 65% of the overall energy usage in the home, with energy usage in the home making up “29% of the UK’s energy consumption” according to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Bremer, 2020). Recent heating systems have been developed with the overall aim of reducing the amount of user input required to effectively use the system while still leaving room for the user to customise their system to a certain extent, resulting in a refined heating system which meets their own personal needs and creates optimal temperature conditions in their home.</p><br>

			<h3>Remote Control of Automated Heating Systems</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="mainText">
			<p>One way in which automated heating systems benefit the environment is in their ability to be controlled remotely. These link the heating system in the home with a separate device, which is normally the user’s mobile phone, however other devices such as laptops and tablets are acceptable. This allows the user to control their heating through an app or website even when they are not at home. This means that if the user is out of the house, then through use of instant messaging (Jin <i>et al.</i>, 2022), they can switch the heating on when coming home, which ensures the house is at optimal temperature for when they arrive. Alternatively, if the user has left the house without turning their heating off, they can rectify this immediately by turning the heating off from their device, whereas if this were the case with a traditional heating system then the user has the options to wait and turn the heating off when they return home – which means they would have to leave the heating on while they were out – or return home to turn the heating off then go back out, which is both time consuming and does not completely avoid unnecessary energy usage. Both scenarios result in the heating being left on for longer than is necessary, increasing energy waste, and if the user is returning home to turn the heating off in a car, this increases the car’s greenhouse gas emissions since the car must travel further, damaging the environment further. Therefore, the remote-control system has an overall positive impact on the environment since it removes the need to leave the heating on for any longer than necessary after remembering to turn it off, therefore minimising energy consumption.</p><br>

			<h3>Energy Savings created by Automated Heating Systems</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="mainText">
			<p>Using these remote-control systems as well other features of intelligent heating systems, steps have been taken to minimise the energy used by UK homes. Features such as heating “zones” (Bremer, 2020) ensure that not every room in the house is heated if this is not required, instead using sensors to detect which rooms are occupied and focus heating on those rooms. Temperature sensors will also switch the heating off once the home reaches a certain temperature, which also minimises the energy used in the home since it means the heating is not switched on and using energy for longer than necessary.</p><br>

		<div id='lighting' class="subTitle">
			<h3>Automated Lighting Systems</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="mainText">
			<p>Another example of a home automation system that has been developed to replace its traditional counterpart to benefit the environment is the introduction of intelligent lighting systems. These systems use similar mechanics to intelligent heating systems to monitor the conditions in the home and adapt appropriately, creating a comfortable and energy efficient environment. As well as allowing the user to control the lights by switching them on and off and changing the brightness, smart lighting systems add a new level of intelligence which reduces the need for the user to interact with the system while still creating the ideal lighting conditions in the home. This is achieved through lighting control systems which contain a “dimming actuator, a controller, brightness sensor” (Vanus <i>et al.</i>, 2013) to monitor the intensity of any external light coming in through the use of the “brightness sensor” and adjust the brightness of the artificial light appropriately. This keeps the light level in the home constant since these systems will automatically turn the brightness of the lighting down if there is a higher level of natural light present and turn them up if there is a lower level of natural light present. This benefits the environment since it does not provide any more light than necessary, which consumes less energy than traditional lighting systems which would use more energy as the lights are more likely to be left on a higher brightness even if this level of artificial lighting is not required.</p><br>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="mainText">
			<p>However, while intelligent home automation systems have the potential to benefit the environment, they could also cause more harm than traditional heating and lighting systems. Since home automation systems are complex in their design, some users may be unsure of how to cope with the additional features which have been added to aid them and as a result they may choose to essentially ignore these features. This removes the environmental benefit created by these systems and instead causes more environmental damage, since the creation of these complex systems requires generation of electricity, which is often achieved by burning fossil fuels, causing an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, it is important that when these intelligent systems are designed, they have a user-friendly interface, allowing all users to utilise all helpful features of these systems and fully maximise the environmental benefit that they can create.</p><br>
