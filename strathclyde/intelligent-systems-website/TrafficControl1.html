          <p>Smart Traffic Control is the integration of intelligent systems and methods of controlling traffic flow. There is a variety of different methods to accomplish this, some being only theoretical, others having been successfully implemented and operational.</p>
          
          <p>One of the most common methods of ‘smart’ traffic control is the use of smart traffic lights. Many of these work by having sensors that detect and identify vehicles at certain places in the junction. Then using a computer, it will alter the timing of the lights to best optimise the traffic flow, reducing the time spent sitting still and wasting fuel, in turn reducing unnecessary emissions.</p>
          
          <p>A private company called NoTraffic has created a system like this, which makes use of both AI (Artificial Intelligence) and multiple cameras overlooking the junction to make decisions about how to best reduce the wait times of all vehicles, thus also reducing the emissions. Their systems have been implemented in a wide range of areas across the USA. Their estimates say that annually, they reduce delays by around 2,700 hours, they also prevent approximately 30 tonnes of carbon being emitted per intersection. (Finkle, 2019)</p>
          
          <p>Another method of reducing emissions is using another style of smart traffic lights, ones which instead transmit data to the cars infotainment system, which show the driver when the light will change via a timer counting down. This was tested for 4 months by Highways England on two different roads (A627(M) & M66), throughout the testing it was shown to have reduced CO2 emissions by up to 27%. Additionally, there was found to be a 17% reduction in NO emission in the surveyed areas. (Paton, 2021) These reductions were most present when examining HGVs (Heavy Goods Vehicles), which cause lots of pollution due to their engines requiring much more fuel than regular vehicles do, as they are required to generate much more power due to their increased weight.</p>
          
          <p>Inbound flow control can also be utilised with smart traffic lights, where lights into the city only allow as many cars to enter as is available space, preventing congestion from forming within the city, which can easily domino into a much larger congestion. As traffic leaves the city, more cars are allowed to enter. This system is currently using in a variety of places, an example being in Zurich, Switzerland. (Smarter Cambridge Transport, 2015) </p>
          
          <p>Smart traffic lights can also be connected to public transport vehicles, giving them a higher priority at traffic lights than other vehicles (Finkle, 2019), which can potentially increase their usage by members of the public, as it may make it faster than travelling in a personal vehicle. This would reduce the total emissions of road vehicles, as less cars are present.</p>
          
          <p>Smart motorways can also aid in reducing vehicle emissions, as electronic signs can also be used to invoke variable speed limits, which can be used to slow traffic and prevent congestion. These work by using cameras to motor traffic flow and adjusting the speeds to allow a higher volume of traffic onto the road, while allowing traffic keep moving. (RAC, 2022) These have been used in England for many years, for example on the M25. From August 1995 to February 2003, emissions were measured to have been reduced from 2% to 8%, depending on what type of emission was being measured. (Highways England, 2005)</p>
