      <h2>Can weather forecasting help tackle climate change?</h2>
      </div>
      
      <div class="mainText">
      <p>Negative environmental effects as a result of extreme weather events or natural disasters is a key issue we face when discussing weather forecasting. New advanced technology surrounding forecasting has the potential to play a large role in helping to tackle climate change and environmental costs, for example, it can be used to lower harmful emissions created by transportation or by accurately predicting where and when extreme meteorological events might happen.  </p>
	  <p>Although we are mainly unable to tell exactly the time and place of natural disasters, there are patterns we can look at to be able to make a well-informed prediction based on previous events. The amount and intensity of wildfires has increased due to recent climate change; however, they can possibly be forecast by scientists by looking at a range of factors, including how dry or humid the environment is, the air temperature, wind speeds, etc. therefore predicting any places where the conditions are met for the area to be prone to wildfires. </p>
	  <p>This could save not only the landscape and any financial costs, but also the lives of different wildlife and even humans. </p>
	  <p>Additionally, climate change and global warming are other issues that can be tackled with the help of numerical forecasting. As we know, when we travel and also when we ship goods to other places around the world, harmful emissions and greenhouse gases are released into the Earth’s atmosphere, causing damage to our ozone layer and trapping heat in (global warming).  </p>
	  <p>However, advanced weather forecasting could play a key role in helping reduce the effects of these damages to the environment, as it could help warn us of potential weather hazards that will have an effect on aviation, such as lightning or the risk of turbulence, or even make use of winds to help plan more efficient routes for the aeroplanes to take based on different algorithms and models. </p>
	  <p>This in turn can make a massive difference in terms of cutting back on these emissions and also reducing the overall of fuel consumption and also the amount of pollution. </p>

	  <h3>Plans for a new supercomputer</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="mainText">
	  <p>All this advanced technology holds the potential to have a considerable impact on the climate if we take advantage of all of the data gathered and use it to help minimise any harmful effects on the environment.  </p>
	  <p>“Using weather information and analytics can help mitigate risks today caused by climate change and can also reduce emissions further reducing future impacts”,explains Michael W. Vandewege, a former director of the Broadcast Meteorology Program at Mississippi State University, further reinforcing the idea that this technology can make a difference, if used in the right ways.  </p>
	  <p>The UK’s Met Office has plans to invest over one billion pounds in building a brand-new supercomputer that aims to improve the computer programs (models) that assist in predicting climate changes impact on the Earth and also simply the precision of weather forecasts. According to Microsoft, this new supercomputer “will be able to carry out 60 quadrillion calculations per second” and store over four million times as much data as any modern-day household laptop.  </p>
