	  <h3>What is weather forecasting? </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="mainText">
	  <p>Weather forecasting is a technique which makes use of a range of tools and methods in order to make an educated weather prediction.  </p>
	  <p>This includes satellites, automated surface-observing systems, supercomputers and many others. Long-term forecasts, for example, 10 days in the future, may be argued to be slightly less reliable due to the fact that our atmosphere is constantly changing, and some may even go as far to describe it as ‘unpredictable’. </p>
      <p>However, with the help of meteorologists and advanced technology, weather forecasting has a great impact on not only our daily lives, but also the future of our planet.  </p>

	  <h3>Satellites </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="mainText">
	  <p>Satellites are arguably the most well-known method of weather forecasting. They provide us with data that is observational by taking images of Earth from space, measuring the energy that radiates from the earth, or even measuring the temperature of the water’s surface that can be analysed by experts to identify different trends in the weather on a large scale.  </p>
	  <p>For example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) newest satellite, JPSS-2 will be used to forecast weather 3-7 days in advance, but also to predict a range of extreme weather events, which can then help us to be better prepared and take the necessary steps in order to prevent or reduce the effects of any weather disasters that may occur.  </p>

	<div class="subTitle">
	  <h3>Supercomputers </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="mainText">
	  <p>Supercomputers are powerful computers which have a very large number of processor cores, not to mention the sheer size of RAM memory also needed to cope with the extreme volume of data that it collects and stores. This means they are also a crucial element within the weather forecasting industry as they make weather forecasts possible by comparing data now with similar patterns from the past to aid in determining what is likely to happen in the future, all based on very complicated mathematical “models”, which is known as numerical forecasting. </p>
	  <p>These computer programs or “models” can solve a variety of equations and imitate what the atmosphere’s conditions will be like in the near or distant future so that meteorologists can interpret it and be able to predict the weathers behaviour before it actually happens. Meteorologists could be able to do the same job as the supercomputers, however, it could take them as long as a few months to do what these machines could complete in mere hours.  </p>
      <p>The most well-known forecasting models include the Global Forecast System (GFS); the North American Model (NAM) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting Model (ECMWF), which was able to accurately predict the strength of Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and also where it would end up.  </p>
