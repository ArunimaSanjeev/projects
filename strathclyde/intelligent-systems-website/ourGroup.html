		<h3>About our group </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="mainText">
		<p>As a group we used each lab session efficiently by using the time to make group decisions and discuss any issues or questions we have about the project. Each member of the group was more than willing to take part in each of the elements of the project and therefore we had no issues with motivation or submitting work. Therefore, we each managed to complete all of the tasks and stages of the assignment on time and to a high standard.  </p>
		<p>We used Microsoft OneDrive as a common place to share all of our work as it could be easily accessed by all members of the group, meaning no one was at a disadvantage if they were absent. We were also able to share resources and create templates for different aspects of the website to share with each other to keep everything consistent and make sure everyone was on the same page with what we wanted our website to be like when it was all put together.  </p>

		<h3> The roles within our group </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="mainText">
		<p>We decided in stage 1 of our project that the fairest way to complete this assignment was to divide the elements of the website equally between us to make sure each member of our group had a task to do and that no one was taking advantage of the other members of the team and off-loading the work.  </p>
		<p>We each took into consideration the skills that would be necessary to complete this assignment and, on top of our individual pages within the website, allocated jobs to do within the project based on what elements of the website that each person was the most confident taking charge in, to ensure everything was completed smoothly and with as little difficulty as possible. </p>
		<p>There were some tasks that requried the full groups input, mostly early on in the project, such as deciding on an overall topic for the website, and then assigning each person's individual subtopics and parts of the website to complete aside from their own pages on individual subtopics. Additionally each person had the job of proof reading and testing everything that went into the website to check for any errors and to make sure it was fit for purpose.  </p>
		<p> The individual roles tasks we each had to complete consisted of:</p>

		<h3>How we made decisions </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="mainText"> 
		<p>Decisions were typically made by a majority vote if a consensus had not already been reached. This worked very well for our group and helped to avoid or prevent any arguments as we had all previously agreed that this was the fairest way of making effective decisions.  </p>

		<h3>Difficulties we faced</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="mainText">
		<p>If group members are absent during the lab, then they could potentially feel like they are falling behind or are being kept out of the loop of the project, however we tackled this as a group by keeping in contact with all members of the group outside of lab times and making sure everyone is kept up to date with all of the recent changes and developments within the project, making sure that we each know how the project is progressing. </p>
