			<h3>What is Home Automation?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="mainText">
			<p>Home Automation takes traditional appliances in the home and enhances the design to achieve more refined conditions and a more optimal environment in the home. They both increase a resident’s ability to create the ideal living environment while also decreasing the required input from the resident. This is achieved through a variety of systems including Activity Recognition, Context Modelling, Anomaly Detection and Resident Identification (Popa <i>et al.</i>, 2018).</p>

			<p>Activity Recognition uses sensors located throughout the building to identify the patterns of the resident’s day to day lives by monitoring their routine each day and analysing the data gathered, which is then used in Context Modelling. This takes the results gathered by the Activity Recognition system and uses the pattern of behaviour it has learned to expect from these residents to create what it has determined to be the ideal environment for the home. Once a pattern of behaviour is established, Anomaly Detection systems can monitor activities and recognise when there is any diversion from what the system has learned to expect and respond by taking whatever action is required, for example sending an alert to the resident. These systems also work to reduce energy costs with the Resident Identification systems which can continuously observe where people are in the home, which allows systems such as heating and lighting systems to target these rooms rather than unnecessarily wasting energy powering rooms which are unoccupied and therefore require no heating or lighting.</p><br>
