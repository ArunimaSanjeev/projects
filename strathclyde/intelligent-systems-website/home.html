			<h2>About Our Site</h2>
			<p>We have chosen to create a website about the environmental impact of intelligent systems. This will explore how advanced technological systems have been developed from their traditional counterpart and how this has impacted the environment.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Subtopic 1 - Traffic Control Systems</h3>
			<p>Smart Traffic Control encapsulates various methods of controlling automotive traffic in order to reduce time spend stopped on the road, easing congestion and reducing emissions. The most common method is using sensors or cameras on traffic lights and adjusting the timing of the lights in order to prevent drivers from sitting still at lights. Other methods have been theorized, such as connecting all cars on the road to a central computer, which will then drive all of them in the most efficient way possible, minimising fuel consumption. These projects have been implemented various countries around the world, allowing them to reduce their total emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
			<p>I will be examining various forms and ideas of smart traffic control, both theoretical and applied. I will also view the impact they have had on the environment.</p>
		</div><br>
		<div>
			<h3>Subtopic 2 - Home Automation Systems</h3>
			<p>Home automation describes the use of various technological systems to increase our ability to control various appliances in the home such as heating and lighting. These systems have made it easier to monitor and control these appliances and to optimize living conditions in the home, which is achieved by gathering information about the daily lives of the home’s residents and perceiving the current environment they are in, allowing them to automatically adapt appropriately without the need for any sort of human interference, for example a heating system will automatically turn down in empty areas of the home and focus on heating areas that are currently occupied. Many home automation systems can also be connected to a smartphone through a website or application which allows remote control of these systems. This benefits the environment by minimizing power usage as by adjusting to the current circumstances this will reduce any unnecessary energy consumption that would otherwise be created by unnecessarily powering empty rooms.</p>
		</div><br>
		<div>
			<h3>Subtopic 3 - Forecasting Systems</h3>
			<p>Advanced weather forecasting allows us to be able to predict the likelihood of extreme weather conditions or “meteorological events” happening by using different tools and methods to collect data to be processed by supercomputers that compare different patterns or past events to produce forecasts for the near and long-term future that are as accurate as possible. For example, satellites that measure the energy that radiates from the earth or even the temperature of the water's surface to assist in long range weather forecasting. This in turn allows us to be better prepared for all kinds of meteorological conditions, which has the possibility of helping us minimize not only financial costs, but also environmental ones.</p>
		</div><br>
		<div>
			<h3>Subtopic 4 - Online Retail</h3>
			<p>Another use of intelligent systems can also be seen within the retail sector. For example, online retail has seen an exponential increase in usage over the past decade, especially after and during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic within which potential customers would be more cautious about reducing exposure to crowded spaces such as shops, and in order to avoid this shopping online seems like a reasonable option. But how does this affect the environment?</p>
			<p>Within this sub-topic we will explore the factors affecting the environment in retail and online retail such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Effects of delivery services on the environment (next day delivery vs standard)</li>
				<li>Carbon footprint of online shopping’s increased packaging (online vs physical)</li>
				<li>Sustainability of materials used by retail stores (e.g., in the fashion industry)</li>
				<li>Impact of trends on the retail sector and how that can have an indirect impact on the environment</li>
			</ul>
		</div><br>
		<div>
			<h3>Subtopic 5 - Internet of Things</h3>
			<p>We are planning to make a webpage on the topic Internet of Things (IoT), which is a giant network with connected devices that are embedded with sensors, used to gather and share information. It helps in reducing energy consumption, assessing factors that harm the ocean, provides economic sustainability using sensors and so on, hence supporting the environment in many ways which is the reason we chose this as a sub-topic. The webpage will be created by gathering valid information from resources like books, newspapers, journals, and various platforms like Google Scholar.</p>
