      <h3>2. Packaging(continued)</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="mainText">
      <p>The many materials that are used in this process in order to keep goods separate and undamaged during transport can be seen to be outdated, unsustainable and quite frankly excessive. When it comes to packaging of goods online there may be various alternatives to unsustainable boxes that are completely discarded upon arrival. Recyclable options are being tried by many companies and paper packages are becoming more popular by retailers however, the majority of retailers are still stuck in the unsustainable seven mentioned above. </p>
      <p>However, interestingly in a study listed from another source conduced that those consumers of the 86.2% which were online customers, only 11.8% felt that the arrived product had immoderate packaging. This is interesting because it highlights the consumers obliviousness to the long-term effects of these packages which are all discarded without further regret.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it can be said that packaging of online goods and e-commerce is far more excessive and unsustainable than physical shopping where packaging is greatly reduced and overall better for the environment.</p>

        <h3>3. Next day delivery vs Standard delivery options</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="mainText">
        <p>The third factor of environmental impact that I will discuss relates to the differences in environmental impact between different delivery options. For example, Next day delivery services vs standard delivery services.</p>
        <p>With the rise of delivery service giants such as Amazon, capability of next day delivery services which were once deemed as impossible are now, very possible, and even somewhat expected by some consumers. But does this have a negative impact on the environment? And if so, is it worth selecting next day options over more ethical standard options? </p>
        <p>Commercial workers are experiencing a lot more pressure because of this sense of entitlement that consumers have over next day delivery which has is being seen to lead to anomalies of cheap next day options when workers are experiences unexpected journeys especially when there is much higher demand for this service.</p>
        <p>For example, increased fuel consumption of vehicles is one way in which next-day delivery can be said to have an increased carbon footprint, as emissions are expected to increase to justify the increasing demands due to vehicle detours on journeys, etc.</p>
        <p>This can be especially as bad when seen by smaller retailers who are being forced to offer this service to stay in competition with rivals in the business who are more suitable to offer it. Some of these retailers will need to sacrifice emissions and contributions to the environmental simply to provide this pressure inducing service.</p>
        <p>Therefore, it can be said that next-day delivery may not be the best option for the environment. Standard may perhaps be ‘more green’ </p>
