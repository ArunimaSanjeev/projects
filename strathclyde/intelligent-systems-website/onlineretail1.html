      <h3>How are Intelligent Systems used in Retail?</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="mainText">
      <p>It can be said that there are a variety of different of different intelligent systems that are used in the retailing industry to a varying degree of environmental impact. Some of these intelligent systems can be of great detriment to the environment and it can be said that there are certainly better alternatives which would be of less negative impact and would greatly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and general co2 emissions.</p>
      <p>For example, the first area of intelligent systems in retailing that I would like to discuss can be seen with regards to online services and delivery of products. As of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an exponential increase in the use of online delivery services, as for the millions of people who are cautious and trying to reduce potential exposure to the virus online services seem to be some of the most convenient options. But are these delivery services detrimental to the environment?</p>
      <p>Well, it can be said that online delivery of goods has three main factors which have a major impact on environmental impact. These three categories that I will discuss are: Transportation of online goods vs physical shopping, Online packaging and wastage vs physical shoppers packaging, Differences in different types of delivery options (Next day delivery vs standard delivery) and how these have different effects on the environment.</p>

    <div class="subTitle">
      <h3>1. Transportation</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="mainText">
      <p>The first factor of environmental impact that I will discuss relates to the transportation of goods from retailer to customer especially when comparing online delivery to physical shopping (The physical act of a customer individually going into a retail store). </p>
      <p>As it so happens online delivery services seem to have a significant advantage over physical shopping in this case. Especially when comparing both methods of transport. It is clear that a great way to reduce emissions of harmful greenhouse gases from transportation is to reduce the number of vehicles eluding such gases. And delivery services seem to have this nailed. The simple fact is that putting more packages into one vehicle greatly reduces the number of potential customers having to individually travel for their goods and so seems to have a positive impact on the environment. </p>
      <p>Therefore, we can say that online delivery services seem to be an effective intelligent system used by retail to reduce emissions on the environment!</p>

    <div class="subTitle">
      <h3>2. Packaging</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="mainText">
      <p>The second factor of environmental impact that I will discuss relates to the packaging of goods in store vs physical shopping and the environmental impact of this in comparison to each other.</p>
      <p>When comparing the transport aspects of online shopping it is easy to be blinded by the positives that such a service can provide. However, one of the main concerns when it comes to online retailing can be seen with regards to the handling of packaging and wastage of deliveries. According to a source from the book ‘Sustainable Waste Management: Policies and Case Studies’ listed in the references, said that: “A typical e-commerce parcel may use up to seven types of packaging materials: plastic bags, woven bags, tape, and buffer materials (bubble wrap, styrofoam)” </p>
